# Refactored_BYTESIZED32
Byte-sized text games for code generation tasks on virtual environments,and In this refactoring process, the aim was to optimize the code for a collection of 32 games with similar structures and mechanics. The key focus areas were modularity, readability, reusability, extensibility, and performance. Each game followed a common pattern with variations in game-specific rules, objects, and actions, which provided an excellent opportunity to abstract shared logic and create a reusable framework.
